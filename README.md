# <Prework Study Guide Webpaeg>

## Description

This webpage was developed as a study aide for student in the coding boot camp. The development of this webpage was needed as a quick and easy way to reference notes while moving forward through the class. It solves the problems of lost hand written notes and compiles information in an easy to find format. Developing this website we learned the basics for setting up file, documents, code and processes that will be used in the future in our class.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
