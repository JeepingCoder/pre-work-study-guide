# <Prework Study Guide Webpaeg>

## Description

This webpage was developed as a study aide for student in the coding boot camp. The development of this webpage was needed as a quick and easy way to reference notes while moving forward through the class. It solves the problems of lost hand written notes and compiles information in an easy to find format. Developing this website we learned the basics for setting up file, documents, code and processes that will be used in the future in our class.
